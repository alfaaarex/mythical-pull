## Initial Opinions

*Agnihotra's Take*:
<br>
When I saw the announcement of Liquid Glass, I had mixed opinions. On one hand, I was excited about the potential for creating stunning, immersive user interfaces that were otherwise super flat and boring. The idea of incorporating realistic glass-like effects into daily ideas was intriguing and promised to add a layer of sophistication and elegance to designs.
<br>
On the other hand, I was concerned about the practicality of implementing such a design system in real-world applications. Liquid Glass relies heavily on complex visual effects, which could pose significant challenges in terms of performance, especially on lower-end devices or in web applications where resources are limited.

*Naitik's Take*:

## Key Points

- Apple's Liquid Glass Design System has been adopted in every piece of software they make, from iOS to macOS.
- It primarily relies heavily on the GPU, in order to render complex refractions, textures, lighting and more.
- You can consider it more of a "Lighting Engine" than a "Design System".
- The complexity of Liquid Glass makes it difficult to implement in web applications, especially when considering performance and responsiveness.

## Design Phase Challenges (By Agnihotra)

*Agnihotra*: 
> Speaking from personal experience, when I served as the Head of Design at Carcino, I had launched an internal mission to recreate liquid glass in our website and content. It was perfect timing, as Figma had also just launched their Glass Effect feature. However, we quickly realized that while the design looked stunning, implementing it the way it looked in design tools was a massive challenge. 
> As for me, the designer, I was enjoying every bit of the Glass Effect feature in Figma. I created mesmerising concepts approved by the entire team, except the developers. The developers were quick to point out that implementing such designs would be a nightmare, especially when considering performance and responsiveness. However, they took it up as a challenge to make Liquid Glass possible.

## Development Phase Challenges (By Naitik)

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome
