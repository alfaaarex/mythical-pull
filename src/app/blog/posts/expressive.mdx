# The Announcement

Google had announced a brand new design language called **Material Expressive** at **I/O 2025**. This new design language builds upon the existing Material You framework, introducing a more dynamic and personalized user experience. As a UX designer, I was excited to explore how these new features could enhance the way users interact with their devices.

Unfortunately, **as an iPhone user**, I would never get these design changes, since Google uses old-school Material Design for all platforms that aren't Android or ChromeOS. But there was one headline that caught my eye: They were going to roll out design changes across all Google services. This was good news to me, as I had a **Pixel 7** lying around, as well as a Moto Edge. I saw this as an opportunity to try something that I might have never asked my phone to do - be an extension of my personality.

## Changes in Android 16

The headlining change in Android 16 was the new visual overhaul. It is mostly noticeable on Pixel devices, which use Google's own android skin and launcher. With the newly announced Pixel 10, the update moves forward in a new direction of Material Design, even though opinions are mixed.

Because I had a Pixel 7, I would not get the Beta that early. So I decided to read and go through the documentation available on [Material.io](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive), and I couldn't help but think that the entire idea felt very half-baked. But that was just the tip of the iceberg, for the real nightmare arrived once they started shipping this new UI in their apps.

## Some Changes in apps:

While there are numerous apps that have since gotten a complete makeover (the irony isn't lost on me), it's impossible for me to cover all of them, so I will be highlighting some of the major ones that feature the new look.

### Exhibit A: Clock

The **Clock** app got a big overhaul. Besides the shorter bottom bar, icons feature an outline design until they’re selected. It’s now “Alarms” and “Timers,” while “World Clock” is a bit more descriptive.

The Alarms tab does a better job of noting what’s active with a bright background, while customization is now handled by a sheet instead of inline controls.

Stopwatch is the next major change with giant buttons for Stop, Reset, and Lap replacing the previous side-by-side icons. Instead of a list, you have cards for lap times, while the ring motif is gone.

### Exhibit B: Google Keep

Besides background color changes, the main update is a search app bar. It’s thicker than before with “Google Keep” appearing initially and then getting replaced by a “Search Keep” hint. The single or multi-column switcher is next with the new “Sort by” option rounding things out. (Google says to not place more than two actions here.)

This field is flanked by your profile picture and hamburger button, with the navigation drawer remaining the same. Tapping to open the search interface reveals pill-shaped icons for everything.

The corner FAB (floating action button) sees a small tweak where the icon for Audio, Image, Drawing, List, or Text now appears first. 

### Exhibit C: Gmail for Android

As spotted by app researcher AssembleDebug (via Android Authority), Google is preparing further Material 3 Expressive changes for the Gmail app on Android. The publication shared screenshots comparing the current Gmail design with the new one, and the differences are significant.

The hamburger menu has been moved outside the search bar, and the Gemini icon is now inside it. The profile icon has also shifted from inside the search bar to outside. The main mailbox view now separates each email with a line — similar to other Google apps with the new design — and the compose button is now more prominently colored.

### Exhibit D: Google Phone

One of the most obvious tweaks there, besides the general embrace of Material 3 Expressive with its big touch-friendly bulbous UI elements, is that new call-pickup control. Rather than discrete buttons for answering or rejecting, I'm seeing the implementation of the new slider interface I’ve been observing in development.

Google says that it’s trying out this new design after getting feedback that it was too easy to accidentally reject a call you actually wanted to take with the old system — or maybe worse, accidentally answering when you didn’t mean to.

## The New Focus

According to the Google research team, users of both younger and older demographics are able to spot key interactions and CTAs faster and take lesser time to take action. In simpler words, there will be less friction between the users and the interface.
If you thought the previous Material Design went out of its way to make elements look fun, this one takes it up a notch for sure. From creative loaders where shapes transform into one-another to wiggly sliders everywhere, this update will give a lot of options and freedom for designers to experiment.

Inconsistency is key? — That is something that I noticed during the Android Show! As designers we preach consistent designs through websites and apps, however Material Expressive is breaking loads of rules.

- Tabs now change shape to stand out and show a highlighted state.
- Floating menus now have variable widths to hug their contents instead of one consistent width.
- An expanded shape library to add delight to sections or buttons.
- Use of variable border radii (the plural of radius) in the same space on screen to provide higher levels of visual distinction.
- A variety of ways typography is used in titles to enhance visual hierarchy and focus on “bold” designs.

And the list goes on.
